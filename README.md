Slide The Revelator
===================

Who's That Writin Reveal.js Slide HTML?  Not me.

This is a very basic setup to be able to write reveal.js slides with significantly less
angle brackets, because I dislike angle brackets.  It prints to stdout.

Various things are rough here, I'm ok with that.  Pull requests would be entertained.

Usage
=====

    chmod +x write_it
    vim test.yml
    write_it test.yml my_presentation_directory
    sensible-browser my_presentation_directory
